# 100 Days Backend Challenge ðŸš€

## Overview
I am starting a **100-day challenge** to **master backend development** and build **scalable, real-world products**.  
The goal is to go from fundamentals to advanced backend skills and implement practical projects that can scale.

---

## Goals
- Learn **Node.js** and **Express** deeply
- Work with **databases** (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Understand **REST APIs, authentication, and authorization**
- Explore **real-time systems** (WebSocket, Socket.IO)
- Build **scalable backend architectures** for modern products
- Practice **deployment** (Heroku, Render, AWS, or Railway)
- Document everything for **learning & portfolio**

---

## Approach
- **Daily progress:** Each day will be a new folder/project under this repo (`day0`, `day1`, etc.)
- **Practice + Build:** Learn concepts and immediately implement small projects or features
- **Project-oriented:** Build apps that solve real problems or can be scaled in the future
- **Version control:** All code will be tracked with Git for practice and portfolio

---

## Folder Structure (Example)
backend/
â”œâ”€ day0/
â”‚ â””â”€ app.js
â”œâ”€ day1/
â”‚ â””â”€ server.js
â”œâ”€ day2/
â”‚ â””â”€ ...
â”œâ”€ node_modules/
â””â”€ package.json
> âœ… Tip: You can install npm packages in the main `backend/` folder and use them in all day folders.
